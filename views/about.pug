            | I spent almost a decade working in customer service and I love communicating with others to acknowledge and address their needs.
            | As my career interests changed, I found a passion for full stack development.
            | As a career changer, I'm excited to bring my unique skill set, including excellent customer service, to the development field.
            | Not only have I learned a lot, but have had so much fun a long the way. I can't wait to learn more.
            | I hope one day to be a mentor to other young women interested in programming.
